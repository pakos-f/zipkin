What is zipkin?

[Zipkin](https://zipkin.io) is a distributed tracing system. 
It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in service architectures. Features include both the collection and lookup of this data.


In this example you will find a setup of 2 microservices (`zipkin-service-1` and `zipkin-service-2`) and a zipkin server which holds and vizualize all logs for both microservices.
